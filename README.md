# File-Uploader
This web app allows users to upload files that are smaller than 20MB to a server. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface that enables users to select a file from their device and upload it to the server.

The app verifies the size of the file before uploading it, and if the file is larger than 20MB, the user will receive an error message and be prompted to select a smaller file.

Once the file is successfully uploaded, the app provides a confirmation message to the user, letting them know that the upload was successful.

This project was created as part of a 100 days of code challenge i participated in with the aim of improving my coding skills.

Overall, this web app provides a reliable and efficient way for users to upload files smaller than 20MB to a server, making it an ideal choice for individuals and businesses that require file sharing and storage capabilities
